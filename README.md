2D World Tile Game 

Welcome to the Build Your Own World (BYOW) project repository. This project involves creating a procedurally generated graphical world, enabling users to explore a unique virtual environment every time they interact with it.

#Project Overview 
The BYOW project is a world simulation program in which users can navigate and interact with a randomly generated 2D tile-based world. The project is primarily built in Java, utilizing libraries like StdDraw for the graphical user interface.

## Features

2. **Interactive Avatar**: Users can control an avatar that can navigate through the world and interact with various objects.
3. **Persistence**: The game supports saving and loading features so you can pick up where you left off.
4. **Graphical User Interface**: The world is visualized using a 2D graphical interface.
